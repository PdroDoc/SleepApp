# 🛌 Sleep Data App – Run Your Sleep, Know Your Patterns

Welcome to the **Sleep Data App**, a personal project designed to visualize, track, and better understand sleep patterns based on data collected from fitness devices.

This app was born from the intersection of **technology, health, self-awareness, and the desire to transform data into insights**. Behind the code, there's also a personal story — a journey of resilience, focus, and presence.
